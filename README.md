# ConnectFourPlus-Project1
Play a game of Connect Four Plus! This assignment is for project 1. 
The objective is to be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.) This connect four can be played at every angle instead of just the traditional from the top row only. Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate. I used a class for the board. I used functions for the tokens and how to place them. I used a lot of else if statements for where to place the tokens. I created newGame, and gameOver functions to start a new game and end a game.
