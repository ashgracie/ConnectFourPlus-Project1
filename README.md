# ConnectFourPlus-Project1
<p>Play a game of Connect Four Plus! This assignment is for project 1. 
The objective is to be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.) </p>

## How To Play
<p> This connect four can be played at every angle instead of just the traditional from the top row only. Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate. </p>

## What It Took To Make This Game
<p> I used a class for the board and token. I used functions for the tokens and how to place them. I used a lot of else if statements for where to place the tokens. I created newGame, and gameOver functions to start a new game and end a game. Creating the grid was the most challenging part for me. And the interface for the winners. I used a global function to make the token locations easier to use.</p>

## I Hope That You Enjoy Playing This Game!
