    <p>This connect four can be played at every 
      angle instead of just the traditional from the 
      top row only. Players must alternate turns, 
      and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 
      On your turn, drop one of your colored discs 
      from the top into any of the seven slots.
       The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.</p>
